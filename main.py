# Setup the initial board:
# Value zero corresponds to an empty cell

# Step 2:
# Fill the cells corresponding to the diagonal sub_grids, with random valid numbers. ensuring they don't violate the rules.
# As they are isolated from the rest of the board,itÂ´s easy to make sure they don't interfere with the others.
# This ensures a balanced distribution of numbers across rows, columns and subgrids. Next step is backtracking algorithm
